# CPS 616 - Algorithms

All the labs done for the Algorithms course (Winter 2019)

### Lab 1 

Sort arrays of different size using:
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- A combination of Merge Sort and Selection Sort
  (Call Selection within Merge sort when size of the array is small enough)

Measure the running time of each of the sorting algorithms

# Lab 2

Implement your own **pow** function in:
- linear time
- lg n time

## Lab 3

implement number multiplication digit by digit using the following divide and conquer algorithms:
- multiply 4
- multiply 3 (Karatsuba Algorithm)

## Lab 4

Given a graph as input, write an algorithm to determine a minimum spanning tree.
Create the following graph and a second graph you define it yourself.

  3 |   2\   | 7
    |      \ |
